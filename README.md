#  Crocodile's Final Project

This project was planned, designed and developed by **bi^3-coders** (Mitra Vahdat, Fatemeh Delkhosh, Mobina Behnam) for Cro.Code.Ile bootcamp organized by **"Part Software Group"** and its' subset, **"Part School"**

The repository contains **project planning & UI design files on "plan" branch**, our **HTML/SCSS developments for the project on "dev" branch** and **final releases on "test" branch**, merged with "main" branch.

## What is it about?
We were working on a localized developing community for resident developers in IRI, so they don't have to deal with the difficulty of networking through English based platforms. 

* **Dev-Hive** is here to make everything easier, from debugging for developers to finding senior/professional human recourses for companies/startups/businesses!


  Note: This project is front-end developed only
